          <h2>Types of Chemical Bonds</h2>
          <p>*Review: Understand that <b>electronegativity</b> (the ability of an electron to attract shared electrons to itself) increases to the right and up on the periodic table</p>
          <p>A Chemical Bond is the attraction between the nucleus of one atom and the electron of another atom:</p>
          <ul>
            <!-- ...existing code... -->
          <ul class="custom-block-list">
            <li><b>Ionic Bonds:</b> Transferring of an electron (usually involving a metal and nonmetal) - this generally occurs when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is greater than 1.7</li>
              <ul>
                <li>While you do not need to memorize electronegativity values for the AP exam (any questions regarding specific values will give you them), you should remember the general trends of electronegativity on the periodic table covered in <a href="/ap-chem/unit-1-atomic-structure/#unit1-7">Unit 1.7 - Periodic Trends</a></li>
              </ul>
            <li><b>Covalent Bonds:</b> Sharing of electrons
              <ul>
                <li><b>Polar Covalent:</b> Electrons shared unequally</li>
                <li><b>Nonpolar Covalent:</b> Electrons shared equally - often only between di-atomic elements like O<sub>2</sub></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Metallic Bonds:</b> Electrons not associated with a single atom or molecule (Delocalized/Electron Seas)</li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>You may see elements with low or high electronegativities be represented by δ+ and δ-, respectively.  Dipole arrows will always point to the more electronegative element.</p>

          <h2>Intramolecular Force and Potential Energy</h2>
          <p><b>Potential Energy Curves</b> for covalent bonds represent the potential energy of a bond at various internuclear distances. The bond is stable when negative and most stable when highly negative (at equilibrium bond length). This would represent the two atoms being in an optimal range for bonding.</p>
          <p>The bond is unstable when positive: this is when the atoms are so close that there is more repulsive force than attractive force.  The distance from the x-axis to the lowest peak is the bond energy - the energy required to break the bond.</p>
          <p>When comparing curves, double and triple bond curves will be more pronounced and have higher negative peaks because they are stronger.</p>

          <p class="image-caption"><i>Most potential energy curves will follow this general trend.</i></p>

          <p>Bonds may be formed in single, double, or triple forms, sharing either 2, 4, or 6 electrons.  The more shared electrons produces a stronger bond</p>
          <br>
          <p>In ionic bonds, the attraction between cations and anions (positive and negatively charged ions) can be explained using <b>Coulomb’s Law:</b></p>

          <h2>Lewis Diagrams</h2>
          <p><b>Lewis Dot Diagrams</b> may be used to represent molecules, showing bond order, unpaired valence electrons, and connectivity between atoms</p>
          <p>In Lewis diagrams, the chemical symbol for atoms is used, along with dots to show electrons, or dashes to represent a bond</p>
          <p>Alloys are the combination of two or more metallic elements</p>
          <p>To construct a Lewis Dot Diagram, count the valence electrons (accounting for ions, either adding for a negative ion or subtracting for a positive ions), then determine the central atom (most electronegative atom) and place the rest of the atoms around it.  Remember that single bonds require 2 electrons, double 4, and triple 6.</p>

Given the choices below which could be this unknown substance?</p>
          <div class="answer-options">
            <button data-correct="true" data-explanation="Correct! Cr is conductive (metallic bonding with delocalized sea of electrons) in both solid and liquid states, can be slightly malleable in some states, and most importantly, commonly forms an interstitial alloy with carbon. This would be the most likely substance from the choices given that the scientist is analyzing.">Chromium (Cr)</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, oxygen would not form an alloy with carbon and is also typically a gas at room temperature.">Oxygen (O)</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, Li is too small to form an interstitial bond with carbon.">Lithium (Li)</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, remember Ne is a noble gas and is not very reactive - this answer choice would not work in this problem.">Neon (Ne)</button>

          <div class="answer-options">
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, in this case we need to use the octet rule, which will allow S to have more than 4 bonding pairs or more than 8 total electrons.">4 bonding pairs, 0 lone pairs</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, this is not the correct use of the octet rule, and all F atoms should be bonded to the S in this Lewis Diagram.">4 bonding pairs, 2 lone pairs</button>
            <button data-correct="true" data-explanation="Correct! The central sulfur atom in SF₆ is S, and it has 6 bonds to each F atom with no lone pairs. Recall S can have 6 bonds in this case because of it's expanded octet.">6 bonding pairs, 0 lone pairs</button>

Molten ionic compounds have free-moving ions that can conduct electricity, whereas in solid ionic compounds, the ions are fixed in place and cannot conduct electricity.">Molten ionic compounds allow ions to move more freely so they can conduct electricity, whereas in solid ionic compounds the ions are fixed in a rigid structure</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, molten ionic compounds do not contain delocatlized seas of electrons, this is only found in metallic bonding.">Molten ionic compounds have a delocalized sea of electrons, which allow electrons to move more freely to conduct electricity than in solid state where there is no delocalization of electrons</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, molten ionic compounds do not have rigid or fixed electrons and this would not cause better conductivity.">Molten ionic compounds are in the liquid form and solid ionic compounds are in the solid form. This means electrons cannot move as free in molten compounds, leading to better conductivity</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, molten ionic compounds do conduct electricity better than solid ionic compounds - crystal lattice structure inhibits conductivity because it is rigid, so solids are generally not conductive.">Molten ionic compounds do not conduct electricity better than solid ionic compounds - solids conduct electricity better because of their robust crystal lattice structure</button>

            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, a bond order of 1.66 would require more double bonds than are present in the molecule. Also be aware that the moles of the CO₃²⁻ do not affect the bond order - this information was only a distraction.">1.66</button>
