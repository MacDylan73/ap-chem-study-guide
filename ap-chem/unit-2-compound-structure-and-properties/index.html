          <h2>Types of Chemical Bonds</h2>
          <p>*Review: Understand that <b>electronegativity</b> (the ability of an electron to attract shared electrons to itself) increases to the right and up on the periodic table</p>
          <p>A Chemical Bond is the attraction between the nucleus of one atom and the electron of another atom:</p>
          <ul>
            <!-- ...existing code... -->
          <ul class="custom-block-list">
            <li><b>Ionic Bonds:</b> Transferring of an electron (usually involving a metal and nonmetal) - this generally occurs when the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is greater than 1.7</li>
              <ul>
                <li>While you do not need to memorize electronegativity values for the AP exam (any questions regarding specific values will give you them), you should remember the general trends of electronegativity on the periodic table covered in <a href="/ap-chem/unit-1-atomic-structure/#unit1-7">Unit 1.7 - Periodic Trends</a></li>
              </ul>
            <li><b>Covalent Bonds:</b> Sharing of electrons
              <ul>
                <li><b>Polar Covalent:</b> Electrons shared unequally</li>
                <li><b>Nonpolar Covalent:</b> Electrons shared equally - often only between di-atomic elements like O<sub>2</sub></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Metallic Bonds:</b> Electrons not associated with a single atom or molecule (Delocalized/Electron Seas)</li>
          </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>You may see elements with low or high electronegativities be represented by δ+ and δ-, respectively.  Dipole arrows will always point to the more electronegative element.</p>

          <h2>Intramolecular Force and Potential Energy</h2>
          <p><b>Potential Energy Curves</b> for covalent bonds represent the potential energy of a bond at various internuclear distances. The bond is stable when negative and most stable when highly negative (at equilibrium bond length). This would represent the two atoms being in an optimal range for bonding.</p>
          <p>The bond is unstable when positive: this is when the atoms are so close that there is more repulsive force than attractive force.  The distance from the x-axis to the lowest peak is the bond energy - the energy required to break the bond.</p>
          <p>When comparing curves, double and triple bond curves will be more pronounced and have higher negative peaks because they are stronger.</p>

          <p class="image-caption"><i>Most potential energy curves will follow this general trend.</i></p>

          <p>Bonds may be formed in single, double, or triple forms, sharing either 2, 4, or 6 electrons.  The more shared electrons produces a stronger bond</p>
          <br>
          <p>In ionic bonds, the attraction between cations and anions (positive and negatively charged ions) can be explained using <b>Coulomb’s Law:</b></p>

          <h2>Structure of Metals and Alloys</h2>
          <p>In <b>metallic bonds</b>, positive metal ions are surrounded by a <b>sea of delocalized electrons.</b>  As a result, metallic bonds are good conductors of electricity, malleable, and ductile</p>

            <li><b>Substitutional Alloys</b> have one metal substituting in for another in the crystal lattice.  They must be of comparable radii.  Ex: Brass = Copper and Zinc</li>
            <li><b>Interstitial Alloys</b> have one metal that is much smaller atomic radii fill in the spaces between the larger metal atoms.  These alloys are usually stronger than the base metal.  Ex: Steel = Carbon in Spaces of Iron Atoms</li>

                <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, a delocalized sea of electrons allows ions to move freely in the compound, making the metal flexible and hard to break when bent or put under pressure.">Malleability</button>
                <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, a delocalized sea of electrons allows ions to move freely in the compound, promoting electrical conductivity.">Electrical Conductivity</button>
                <button data-correct="true" data-explanation="Correct! A substance is brittle when it breaks easily when bent or under pressure. Ionic compounds would be brittle, because if the cations and anions are pressed together too much, they will repel each otehr and fracture the solid structure. Metallic bonding on the other hand is very flexible and harder to break because the delocalized sea of electrons minimizes any repulsion.">Brittleness</button>
                <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, ductility refers to the ability of a material to be drawn into wires. Because metallic bonds with delocalized seas of electrons are malleable and good conductors, they are also perfect for making wires.">Ductility</button>
