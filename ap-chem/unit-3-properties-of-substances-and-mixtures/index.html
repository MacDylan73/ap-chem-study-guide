          <h2>Intermolecular and Interparticle Forces</h2>
          <p><b>Intramolecular forces</b> are <b>within</b> a single molecule</p>
          <p><b>Intermolecular forces</b> are <b>between</b> two separate molecules</p>
          <br>
          <p>Intermolecular forces occur between two different molecules.  For example, in water, the H molecule carries a slight positive charge, while the O molecule carries a slight negative charge.  This results in hydrogen in one water molecule being attracted to the oxygen of another.</p>
          <p>Intermolecular forces are Coulombic, like covalent and ionic bonds, but are generally weaker than intramolecular forces.</p>

          <br>
          <p><b>Important: </b>Intermolecular forces help to explain surface tension of liquids, in addition to melting and boiling points. This is because the stronger intermolecular forces are, the more energy is required to disperse molecules, which increases surface tension or melting/boiling points.</p>
          <ul class="custom-block-list">
            <li>
              <b>London Dispersion Forces</b> (LDFs), are caused by very slight polarization of the nonpolar molecules due to changes in the electron field around them.  London Dispersion Forces are the primary type of bonding among nonpolar molecules, but may also happen with polar molecules.  The larger the electron field, the more polarizable it will be.  This is typically the weakest type of intermolecular force but could be the strongest if the molecules are large.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              In <b>Dipole-Induced Dipole</b> bonds, a dipole will temporarily cause a nonpolar molecule to become polar in an attractive force.  When the molecules move apart again, the nonpolar molecule will become nonpolar again.  Ex: O₂ in water, H₂O experiences temporary polarization from the negative or positive dipoles of water.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <b>Dipole-Dipole</b> is a type of intermolecular bond that is between any polar molecules.  The molecules will generally orient themselves to maximize attraction and avoid repulsion.  The strength of the reaction will be determined by the magnitude of the dipole.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <b>Hydrogen Bonding</b> is an extremely strong form of dipole-dipole bonding:
              <ul class="custom-block-list">
                <li>Hydrogen only occurs between H and an O F or N atom</li>
                <li>Hydrogen bonding occurs between molecules: it is not truly “bonding”</li>
                <li>The Hydrogen bonded to an O F or N atom donates its electron, leaving just a positive nucleus.  This will form an extremely strong attraction to other negative ions in a different molecule</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              When Ionic Compounds dissolve in an aqueous solution, they form <b>Ion-Dipole Interactions</b>:
              <ul class="custom-block-list">
                <li>Melting and boiling points, surface tension, viscosity, and heat of vaporization will increase as IMF increases</li>
                <li>Vapor pressure, volatility will decrease as IMF increases</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>When two molecules have approximately the same number of electrons (same mass), then Hydrogen Bonding > Dipole-Dipole > LDF.  If two molecules have vastly different amounts of electrons and the same types of IMFs, then the larger molecules will have stronger IMFs</p>

              Liquid water is formed from 0 to 100 celsius, has vibrational and translational freedom and faster moving particles. Liquid water is very dense because of the strong hydrogen bonding between molecules

          <p><b>V:</b> Volume (L)</p>

          <p><b>T:</b> Temperature measured in Kelvin (K)</p>
          <br>
          <p>Using the Ideal Gas Law:</p>
          <ul class="custom-block-list">
            <li>P and V are inversely related</li>

            <li>R connects all of the units/values together</li>

          <p>Mole Fraction (χᵢ) is the ratio of the moles of one gas in a mixture to the total number of moles of gasses.

          <h2>Kinetic Molecular Theory</h2>
          <p><b>Kinetic Molecular Theory:</b> Particles in gasses are in constant random motion, and between collisions will have a constant velocity and direction.  After collisions the particles will have a new velocity and direction - collisions do not stick, they are elastic collisions.  This summarizes the behavior of ideal gasses.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Note that Kinetic Energy is represented by the following equation:</p>
          <br>
          <p>KE = ½ m v²</p>
          <br>
          <p>At the same temperature, heavier particles will move slower than the lighter particles because of their higher mass.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Pressure</b> is the result of molecules colliding with the container walls.  Particles with different masses will exert the same pressure because they are moving at different speeds when colliding with the walls.  Theoretically, higher molecular size would give the particle a larger volume and therefore less spacing (higher pressure), but this is generally assumed to be negligible, and ideal gasses will be assumed to have <b>zero volume.</b></p>

          <h2>Deviation from Ideal Gas Law</h2>
          <p>In an ideal gas:</p>
          <ul class="custom-block-list">
            <li>Collisions are <b>perfectly elastic</b> - no sticking</li>
            <li>There is <b>no attraction or repulsion</b> between particles</li>
            <li>Particles have a <b>negligible volume</b> - they are just points</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If all of this is true, the Ideal Gas Law is functional and can be accurately used.</p>
          <br>
          <p>However, in real gasses, there will be some volume and there will be intermolecular forces (IMFs).  As IMFs increase, the actual pressure will decrease because the particles are more attracted to each other, reducing impacts on the container walls.  Only at high temperatures do these IMFs become negligible because they are moving so fast. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Likewise, if molecular volume is increased (or volume of container is decreased), the pressure will also increase because there will be less space between the wall and between molecules.  At lower pressures, this is close to negligible because there is more ample room between particles</p>
          <br>
          <p>Thus, gasses might exhibit non-ideal behavior when:</p>

          <h2>Separation of Solutions and Mixtures</h2>
          <p><b>Filtration</b> uses molecular size to filter, and this does not work with liquid solutions where particles are always closer in size and very small. It must also consider whether particles have significant intermolecular attractions.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Chromatography</b> uses a thin paper to separate components of a solution using the solutions attractive/intermolecular forces:</p>
          <ul class="custom-block-list">
            <li>The chromatography paper is dipped into the solvent but the ink/sample spot is not submerged</li>
            <li>The paper is the <b>stationary phase</b> (it is not moving) while the solvent is the <b>mobile phase</b> (because it moves up the paper)</li>
            <li>If the stationary phase is highly polar, more polar components of a solvent will be more attracted to the paper (and will not travel very far), while the less polar components will have less attraction to the paper and will travel higher up the paper with the solvent</li>
            <li>If the stationary phase is nonpolar/not highly polar, more polar components of a solvent will be more attracted to the solvent rather than the paper, and will consequently travel higher on the paper.  Less polar components of the solvent will have slightly less attraction to the solvent and will thus not travel as high on a low/no polarity stationary phase.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p><b>Distillation</b> separates chemical species using the effects of intermolecular forces on vapor pressures:</p>
          <ul class="custom-block-list">
            <li>Because one component (liquid) may have a different boiling point when heating a solution, the lower boiling point will occur first, evaporating that liquid and sending it through a condensation tube to yield a pure liquid</li>
            <li>Liquids with weaker intermolecular forces will have lower boiling points and will be produced (the distillate) by distillation</li>

          <br>
          <p><b>c = λ v</b></p>

          <p><b>v</b> = frequency, in Hz (Hertz) or s⁻¹</p>
          <br>
          <p>When a photon is absorbed or emitted from a molecule, the molecule will lose/gain the amount of energy equal to the photon.  Energy is represented in <b>Planck’s Equation</b>:</p>

          <h2>Beer-Lambert Law</h2>
          <p>Instruments like spectrophotometers and colorimeters can be used to determine the absorbance of a chemical species</p>
          <br>
          <p>The <b>Beer-Lambert Law</b> relates the absorption of light by a solution:</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>A = ε b c</b></p>
          <br>
          <p>Where:</p>
          <p><b>A</b> = Absorbance Measurement</p>
          <p><b>ε</b> = Molar Absorptivity (how intensely a sample absorbs light of a specific wavelength)</p>
          <p><b>b</b> = Path Length</p>
          <p><b>c</b> = concentration</p>
          <br>
          <p>Usually the path length and the wavelength will be constant to measure the absorptivity at different concentrations</p>
          <p>Again note that this formula will be given on the AP exam, so you should focus on understanding how to plug any given values in to use it to find an unknown.</p>

            <button data-correct="true" data-explanation="Correct! Hydrogen bonding must occur between a hydrogen atom bonded to an O, F, or N, and the lone pair on an O, F, or N of a different molecule. In this case, we have a lone pair on the NH₃ molecule that can hydrogen bond with the H bonded to the O in CH₃OH.">NH₃</button>

          <p class="question-text">(3.10) A student accidentally spills vegetable oil on a lab bench. To clean it up, they try rinsing the surface with water, but the oil remains. Their lab partner suggests using hexane (C₆H₁₄) instead, and the oil dissolves easily. Which of the following best explains why hexane is more effective than water at cleaning the vegetable oil?</p>
          <div class="answer-options">
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, hexane is not polar - it is nonpolar. We also know the oil must be nonpolar because if the water (which we know is polar) failed to dissolve and rinse it away, then the oil must be nonpolar because like dissolves like.">Hexane is polar and easily dissolves with also polar vegetable oil</button>
            <button data-correct="true" data-explanation="Correct! Since like dissolves like and we know that water is polar, the vegetable oil must be nonpolar. This would mean that the nonpolar hexane would be effective at dissolving the nonpolar oil.">Hexane is nonpolar and interacts with the oil through london dispersion forces</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, water is not nonpolar - it is very polar. Remember like dissolves like.">Water is nonpolar and cannot interact with the highly polar vegetable oil</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, if both the water and the oil were highly polar, the oil wouldve been rinsed away by the water effectively. Since it was not and we know water is polar, the oil must be nonpolar, so this answer is not true.">Water is highly polar and can hydrogen bond with the polar oil</button>
