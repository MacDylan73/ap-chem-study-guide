          <h2>Introduction to Titration</h2>
          <p><b>Titration</b> is an experiment where a solution of known concentration (the titrant) is added through a burette to a beaker with a solution of unknown concentration (analyte) to determine the number of moles in the unknown solution.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The <b>equivalence point</b> is reached when the titrant from the burette has completely reacted with the analyte.  An <b>indicator</b> is added to the analyte so it will change colors at the equivalence point.  The end point is the point where the indicator changes color.</p>
          <br>
          <p>A titration curve may depict progress of titration.  The point on the curve where the pH change is greatest represents the volume of titrant needed to react with the analyte in stoichiometric ratios.</p>

            <ul class="custom-block-list">
              <li>In Acid-Base Reactions, neutralization reactions will occur</li>
              <li>Based on Bronsted-Lowry Acids and Bases, the acid will donate a proton (H+), and the base will accept a proton (H+)</li>
              <li>The acid forms a conjugate base (by removing the proton or H+) and the base forms a conjugate acid (by accepting the proton or H+)</li>
              <li>Ex: HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) ‚Üí NaCl(aq) + H‚ÇÇO(l). HCl is the acid and NaOH is the base, NaCl has lost a proton and is the conjugate base (specifically the Cl- ion), H‚ÇÇO gained a proton and is the conjugate acid.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Oxidation-Reduction(Redox) Reactions</b>
            <ul class="custom-block-list">
              <li>Redox reactions involve the transfer of one or more electrons between reactants.  Electrons are transferred from the substance that is oxidized to the species that is reduced</li>
              <li>Oxidation is loss of electron, reduction is gain of electron: <i>Oil Rig</i></li>
              <li>Use oxidation numbers to determine reduction and oxidation species</li>
              <li>Ex: Zn(s) + Cu¬≤‚Å∫(aq) ‚Üí Zn¬≤‚Å∫(aq) + Cu(s). Zn is oxidized (loses electrons) and Cu¬≤‚Å∫ is reduced (gains electrons). You may not always have them charges in the equation so you need to be able to determine them</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Precipitation Reactions</b>
            <ul class="custom-block-list">
              <li>Precipitation reactions involve mixing ions in aqueous solutions to produce an insoluble ionic compound - the precipitate</li>
              <li>All sodium, ammonium, nitrate, and potassium salts are soluble in water</li>
              <li>Ex: AgNO‚ÇÉ(aq) + NaCl(aq) ‚Üí AgCl(s) + NaNO‚ÇÉ(aq). AgCl is the precipitate that forms because Ag‚Å∫ and Cl‚Åª form an insoluble compound</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>When determining what type of reaction is occuring, you should check for acid-base and redox reactions first because precipitation reactions can be more difficult to identify.</p>

          <p>Redox reactions can be separated into their half-reactions (the reduction and the oxidation reactions), then the two separate equations must be balanced to contain an equal number of electrons gained and lost.

          <div class="answer-options">
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, because there are bubbles appearing as the metal dissapeared we can conclude that it did not just melt - it reacted with the acid and a new substance (the gas in the bubbles) was produced.">Physical because the metal dissolving with the acid does not change chemical composition</button>

            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, remember that to get between molecules or number of particles and moles, use Avagadro's number. Divide the number of molecules by Avagadro's number to get moles of H‚ÇÇ, then complete the stoichiometry as normal.">4.5 g</button>
            <button data-correct="true" data-explanation="Correct! The molecules of H can be converted to moles by dividing by Avagadro's number: 3.01 x 10¬≤¬≥ molecules H‚ÇÇ / 6.022 x 10¬≤¬≥ molecules H‚ÇÇ = 0.5 moles H‚ÇÇ. The balanced equation shows that 2 moles of H‚ÇÇ produce 2 moles of H‚ÇÇO, so 0.5 moles of H‚ÇÇ will produce 0.5 moles of H‚ÇÇO.

          <div class="answer-options">
            <button data-correct="true" data-explanation="Correct! 88.0 grams of propane (C‚ÇÉH‚Çà) is 2 moles (88.0 g / 44.1 g/mol). The balanced equation shows that 1 mole of C‚ÇÉH‚Çà produces 3 moles of CO‚ÇÇ, so 2 moles of C‚ÇÉH‚Çà will produce 6 moles of CO‚ÇÇ.">6 mol</button>
            <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, this is the number of moles of propane (C‚ÇÉH‚Çà), to get to the moles of CO‚ÇÇ produced, you need to use the stoichiometric ratios from the balanced equation. Each mole of C‚ÇÉH‚Çà produces 3 moles of CO‚ÇÇ.">2 mol</button>
