        <p>Questions can be both single, standalone questions or in sets based on stimulus (graphs, charts, passages, etc.).  Each question has 4 answer choices</p>
        <p>You may use your graphing calculator (or the built-in calculator), as well as the provided formula and periodic table sheets.  Scratch paper is provided</p>
        <p>Answer choices may be numerical, chemical, or conceptual. You may not always find the best answer or exact number you calculate as a result - always choose the closest answer choice</p>
        <p>Remember to use process of elimination and estimation to narrow down potential answer choices when you are unsure of the answer</p>
        <p>There is no penalty for guessing, so make sure to answer every question</p>
        <p>Aim to spend roughly <b>1 Minute and 30 Seconds per question</b></p>
