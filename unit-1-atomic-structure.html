          <h2>Moles and Molar Mass</h2>
          <p><strong>6.02 √ó 10¬≤¬≥</strong> is the number of particles (or things) in a mole.</p>
          <p>Given 1 mol of two different substances, it is possible for them to have different weights because the particles in each may have different masses.</p>
          <p>Given a chemical formula, such as <strong>C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇH‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ</strong>, you can determine the mass of each individual atom by multiplying the number of atoms by its atomic mass:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>12C √ó 12.01 g/mol = 144.12 g of Carbon</li>
            <li>22H √ó 1.01 g/mol = 22.22 g of Hydrogen</li>
            <li>11O √ó 15.999 g/mol = 176.00 g of Oxygen</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The molar mass for the entire <strong>C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇH‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ</strong> compound is the sum of each part:</p>
          <p><strong>144.12 g C + 22.22 g H + 176.00 g O = 342.3 g of C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇH‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Molar mass</strong> is used to convert between moles and grams of a substance. The ratio can be used either way to convert:</p>

          <h2>Mass Spectra of Elements</h2>
          <p>Mass spectra is used to identify the isotopes of an element and their relative abundances.  An isotope is a variation of an element by the number of neutrons in the atom.  This variation in neutrons in the nucleus of an element is why some isotopes of the same element have different weights</p>
          <img src="images/cl-spectrum.png" alt="Mass spectrum of chlorine" class="spectrum-img">
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> In the periodic table above, Cl is present in two isotopes: Cl-35 and Cl-37. The ratio of Cl-35 to Cl-37 is roughly 3:1, which is why the atomic mass shown on the periodic table is 35.45g</p>
          <img src="images/zr-spectrum.png" alt="Mass spectrum of zirconium" class="spectrum-img">
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> With the graph of an unknown element like the one shown above, we can estimate two whole numbers the average mass will fall between based on their relative abundances.  Above, a large portion of the element has an isotope at 90 amu, but also has a small amount around 94 and 96 amu.  When averaged out we would estimate the avergage atomic mass to be around 91 or 92 amu, which looking on the periodic table we can see is closest to the element Zirconium (Zr) which is 91.22 amu </p>

          <h2>Elemental Comparison of Pure Elements</h2>
          <p>All pure substances (both elements and compounds) have fixed composition, meaning that the elements present and the ratio of those elements is the same in every sample of the substance</p>
          <p>  <strong>Ex.</strong>Every sample of NaCl has a 1:1 ratio of Na to Cl atoms</p>
          <br>
          <p>The fixed ratio also applies to the mass of the pure substance</p>
          <p>  <strong>Ex. </strong>Every sample of NaCl has 39.34% of its mass made up of Na and 60.66% made up of Cl</p>
          <br>
          <p>The percent composition of an element in a compound is the weight of the element over the weight of the entire compound</p>
          <p>  <strong>Ex. </strong>Na/NaCl ‚Üí 22.99/58.44 ‚Üí 39.34% of NaCl mass is made of sodium</p>
          <br>
          <p>Theoretically, two different compounds can have the same composition by mass if they are in the same ratio, for example, NO‚ÇÇ and N‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ have the same composition by mass</p>
          <p>An <strong>empirical formula </strong>is the simplified ratio for a compound with the lowest value of whole number subscripts for each atom while maintaining the same ratio.  Following on from the example above, the empirical formula for N‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ would be the compound NO‚ÇÇ , given it maintains the same ratio of atoms and cannot be reduced further.</p>
          <p>The N‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ formula would be a <strong>chemical or molecular formula </strong>- a formula representing a different compound, but not the most simplified form.  <i>NO‚ÇÇ may be considered both an empirical and molecular formula.</i></p>
          <div>
          <p><strong>To determine the empirical formula </strong>of a compound based on its percent composition, you can first convert the g of each atom to moles (if the percent composition is given by percentage, simply replace the percent with grams).  After determining the number of moles for each atom, divide each value by the lowest number of moles.  </p>
          <p>This results in values for each atom very close to a whole number (multiply all the values by a common value if needed to get all values to a whole number), which represents the molecular (chemical) formula.  From this, the empirical formula can be determined as normal.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>This can also be applied to combustion reactions where H‚ÇÇO is removed from a hydrated substance via combustion to produce an anhydrous substance (without water).  Finding the moles of water and the substance will allow you to find the molecular formula for the reaction.  </p>

          <h2>Composition of Mixtures</h2>
          <p>Mixtures contain more than one pure substance, and may have variable amounts of the pure substances that compose them.  Solutions are examples of mixtures - keeping in mind that <strong>M (Molarity) = (moles of solute) / (Liters of solution)</strong></p>
          <p>* Note that while two different atoms combined together would be classified as a mixture, if the atoms are forming a <strong>molecule</strong> and are <strong>not separated in the mixture</strong>, there is only a pure substance made up of the compound.  Diatomic elements (ex O2) would therefore also be classified as a pure substance when alone.  </p>
          <br>
          <p>The elemental composition of a mixture can be used to determine the relative amounts of the pure substances that make it up through <strong>elemental analysis</strong>.  This determines how pure a substance is.</p>
          <p><strong>Ex. </strong>A 2.4g sample of a mixture of CaCl2 and NaCl contains .12g of Na, what percent of the sample is NaCl?</p>
          <p>First convert to moles of Na, then convert to moles of NaCl, and finally convert to grams of NaCl.  This results in .305g of NaCl (.12g Na / 22.99g Na per mol * 1 mol Na per 1 mol NaCl * 58.44g NaCl per mol NaCl) , and therefore about 13% of the sample of the mixture is NaCl (.305/2.4 = 12.7 --> about 13%)</p>

          <h2>Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration</h2>
          <p>Recall the Structure of an Atom:</p>
          <p>Atoms contain a <strong>positively charged nucleus </strong>(made up of <strong>positively charged protons and neutral charged neutrons</strong>) and are surrounded by <strong>negatively charged electrons </strong> which are organized into valence shells</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Coulomb's Law </strong>is used to calculate the force between two particles:</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>F = K (q‚ÇÅ ¬∑ q‚ÇÇ / r¬≤)</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>Where <strong>q‚ÇÅ and q‚ÇÇ </strong>are the electrical charges of the respective particles, and <strong>r </strong>is the distance between the nuclei of the particles.  A negative F represents attraction (since the charges would be opposite), whereas a positive F represents repulsion (since the charges would be the same sign).  A higher magnitude of charges will result in stronger force, as will a smaller radius between the particles. </p>
          <p>Coulomb‚Äôs Law may be used to predict the <strong>ionization energy </strong>of an atom, or the amount of energy required to remove an electron from the atom.  Know that larger atoms will have a greater magnitude of positive change in the nucleus (resulting in more energy required to remove an atom), as well as the fact that as electrons get further out from the nucleus (such as in later valence shells) the attraction to the nucleus will be weaker and thus less energy will be required to remove the electron.  </p>

          <p><strong>Periodicity </strong>refers to the repetitive patterns that occur in the periodic table - these allow accurate predictions to be made regarding atomic properties when no specific information is given:</p>

              <ul class="custom-block-list">
                <li>Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom, and is closely related to atomic radii</li>
                <li>Larger atomic radii (left and down on the periodic table) results in weaker attraction between the nucleus and electrons - thus there is a low ionization energy</li>
                <li>Smaller atomic radii (right and up on periodic table) results in stronger attraction between the nucleus and electrons - thus there is a high ionization energy</li>

          <h2>Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds</h2>
          <p><strong>Valence electrons </strong>are the outer shell electrons (in the S and P subshells), and typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are determined by their location on the periodic table:</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Group 1: +1</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Group 2: +2</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Group 17: -1</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>The charges for each group can be used to predict how elements will bond in ionic compounds.  Ionic compounds will tend to have zero net charge so it is important to use subscripts if necesary to balance charges</p>
          <p><strong>Ex. </strong>Na and Cl bond in a 1 to 1 ratio (NaCl) because the -1 and +1 charge cancel each other out, but if Cl were to bond with Mg it would do so in a 1:2 ratio (MgCl‚ÇÇ) because 2 charges of -1 from Cl cancel with the +2 from Mg</p>

        <p class="question-text">(1.5, 1.7) What element will bond most strongly with Ca and why?</p>
        <div class="answer-options">
          <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, while O is more electronegative this is not the main reason why O will have a stronger bond with Ca than S">O, because O is more electronegative</button>
          <button data-correct="true" data-explanation="Correct!  O will bond most strongly because it has a smaller atomic radius than S. This means that the positive nucleus of O will be closer to Ca than the nucleus of S would be, resulting in stronger attractions">O, because O has a smaller atomic radius</button>
          <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, although it is true that S has a greater electron affinity, this does not cause it to bond more strongly with Ca">S, because S has a greater electron affinity</button>
          <button data-correct="false" data-explanation="Incorrect, S does not have a greater first ionization energy than O">S, because S has a higher first ionization energy</button>
