    "question": "What is the molar mass of Sodium Sulfate (Na₂SO₄)?",
    "answers": [
      "109.97 g/mol",
      "142.05 g/mol",
      "98.43 g/mol",
      "119.11 g/mol"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "To find the molar mass, add up the atomimc masses of each element in the compound: Each Na has a mass of 22.99 g/mol, so 45.98 g/mol of Na. The one S has a mass of 32.07 g/mol. The four oxygens each have masses of 16.00 g/mol, so 64.00 g/mol of O.  When we add these masses up, we get 45.98 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 142.05 g/mol"

    "question": "How many moles are in 32g of Oxygen gas (O₂)?",
    "answers": [
      ".5 mol",
      "1 mol",
      "1.5 mol",
      "2 mol"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "First find the molar mass of Oxygen gas - note it is diatomic, so there are two oxygens.  16.00 g/mol x 2 = 32.00 g/mol.  Now to find the moles, we divide the mass provided by the molar mass (32g / 32 g/mol = 1 mol of O₂)"

    "question": "A sample contains .250 mol of Aluminum. How many atoms are present in this sample?",
    "answers": [
      "6.022 x 10²²",
      "2.409 x 10²³",
      "3.011 x 10²²",
      "1.506 x 10²³"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Recall Avagadro's Number: 6.022 x 10²³ atoms/particles in each mol of any element. Given this, we can multiply the .250 mol of Al by Avagadro's Number to get about 1.506 x 10²³ atoms in the sample of Al."

    "question": "An isotope of Carbon has a mass number of 14. Determine the number of neutrons in a single atom of this isotope",
    "answers": [
      "8",
      "7",
      "6",
      "14"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The mass number of an element or isotope is roughly the number of protons and neutrons added together. So in this case, we have a mass number of 14, and we know carbon has 6 protons because 6 is it's atomic number. This means it has (14 - 6 = 8) 8 neutrons in an atom of this particular isotope"

    "question": "A sealed container holds 125g of Calcium Phosphate (Ca₃(PO₄)₂). How many moles of Calcium Phosphate are present inside the container?",
    "answers": [
      ".40 mol",
      ".60 mol",
      ".80 mol",
      "1.00 mol"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "First, calculate the molar mass of calcium phosphate. Keep in mind the number of each element: 3 Ca, 2 P, and 8 O (dont miss the subscript 2 after the phosphate!). Multiplying the numbner of each element by their atomic masses on the periodic table yields 120.24g of Ca, 61.94g of P, and 128.00g of O - so the molar mass of Calcium Phosphate is 310.18 g/mol. Now just divide the 125g in the problem by the molar mass to find the total number of moles of Ca₃(PO₄)₂ present: about .40 mol"
