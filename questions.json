    "question": "What is the molar mass of Sodium Sulfate (Na₂SO₄)?",
    "answers": [
      "109.97 g/mol",
      "142.05 g/mol",
      "98.43 g/mol",
      "119.11 g/mol"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "To find the molar mass, add up the atomimc masses of each element in the compound: Each Na has a mass of 22.99 g/mol, so 45.98 g/mol of Na. The one S has a mass of 32.07 g/mol. The four oxygens each have masses of 16.00 g/mol, so 64.00 g/mol of O.  When we add these masses up, we get 45.98 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 142.05 g/mol"
