    "question": "What is the molar mass of Sodium Sulfate (Na₂SO₄)?",
    "answers": [
      "109.97 g/mol",
      "142.05 g/mol",
      "98.43 g/mol",
      "119.11 g/mol"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "To find the molar mass, add up the atomimc masses of each element in the compound: Each Na has a mass of 22.99 g/mol, so 45.98 g/mol of Na. The one S has a mass of 32.07 g/mol. The four oxygens each have masses of 16.00 g/mol, so 64.00 g/mol of O.  When we add these masses up, we get 45.98 + 32.07 + 64.00 = 142.05 g/mol"

    "question": "How many moles are in 32g of Oxygen gas (O₂)?",
    "answers": [
      ".5 mol",
      "1 mol",
      "1.5 mol",
      "2 mol"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "First find the molar mass of Oxygen gas - note it is diatomic, so there are two oxygens.  16.00 g/mol x 2 = 32.00 g/mol.  Now to find the moles, we divide the mass provided by the molar mass (32g / 32 g/mol = 1 mol of O₂)"
