      <h1>Welcome to AP Prep Hub – Your Ultimate AP Chemistry Study Guide!</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The AP Prep Hub AP Chemistry Course Guide was created by a college student and former AP Chemistry student who scored a 5 on this exam — alongside ten other 5s on AP exams during high school. This guide is built to help students truly understand the material, develop mastery, and maximize their scores both in the classroom and on the AP exam. 
      </p>
      <p>
        All content put together in the AP Prep Hub AP Chemistry Course Guide is intentional and focused on what matters most for the AP Exam, with notes, quizzes, and study tools inspired by real student experience.  
      </p>
      <p>
