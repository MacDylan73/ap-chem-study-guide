      <h1>Welcome to the Sample AP Chemistry Course Guide</h1>
      <p>
        Created by a former AP Chem student who scored a 5 on the exam, this site is designed to help you understand every concept in each unit, as well as the types of questions you will be expected to answer on your AP exam.  All content in this course is based directly on information from the College Board CED and AP Classroom.
